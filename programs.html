      <h2>Our Programs</h2>
      <p>Flowers On Thorns CBO runs structured programs targeting vulnerable youth and young mothers in Roysambu Sub-county and its surroundings. Our interventions are guided by the needs of the community and inspired by lived experiences of recovery, resilience, and hope.</p>

      <h3>1. Psychosocial Support</h3>
      <p>We offer safe spaces for healing through one-on-one counseling, group therapy, trauma healing, and mental wellness support. Most of our beneficiaries have survived gender-based violence, addiction, or abandonment. The psychosocial program is foundational to all our other services.</p>

      <h3>2. Vocational and Skills Training</h3>
      <p>We equip youth with employable and business skills to enable economic independence. Trainings are offered in partnership with technical trainers and institutions. Current skill areas include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hairdressing and Beauty Therapy</li>
        <li>Tailoring and Fashion Design</li>
        <li>Catering and Baking</li>
        <li>Parenting and Life Skills</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Economic Empowerment</h3>
      <p>We support youth and mothers to start income-generating activities after training. Beneficiaries receive business mentorship, startup kits, or referrals to microfinance partners. Some have started salons, grocery shops, food stalls, or tailoring businesses near their homes.</p>

      <h3>4. Life Skills & Mentorship</h3>
      <p>We train youth on self-awareness, self-esteem, decision-making, leadership, communication, and reproductive health. Peer mentorship and community role models guide them on behavior change and long-term planning.</p>

      <h3>5. Care Packages & Community Outreach</h3>
      <p>We provide care packages and support to vulnerable families including foodstuffs, clothing, sanitary towels, baby items, and school uniforms. Outreach is conducted in slums, informal settlements, and during community forums.</p>

      <h2>Our Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 300 youth reached through awareness and outreach since 2015</li>
        <li>More than 120 trained in vocational skills and psychosocial healing</li>
        <li>Dozens of small businesses launched by graduates from the program</li>
        <li>10+ strategic partners including training institutions, churches, and CBOs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We continue to measure our impact by tracking growth in mental wellness, employability, community reintegration, and household stability.</p>
