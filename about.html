    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p><strong>Flowers On Thorns CBO</strong> is a community-driven initiative based in Roysambu, Nairobi County, Kenya. It was founded by <strong>Ruth Njeri</strong>, a 39-year-old community mobilizer, whose life journey through hardship, addiction, imprisonment, and loss inspired her to give back by empowering vulnerable youth. Raised in Juakali Marurui slums, Ruth overcame early struggles and founded the organization to provide hope and support to youth facing similar challenges.</p>

    <p>The organization began in 2015 as <em>Jua Kali Young Moms Self-Help Group</em> and rebranded to <strong>Flowers On Thorns</strong> in 2020, officially registering as a CBO in November 2024. The name reflects the beauty and strength that can emerge from adversity.</p>
