      <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <h3>Ruth Njeri</h3>
        <p>Flowers On Thorns CBO was founded by Ruth Njeri, a 39-year-old community mobilizer who was born and raised in Juakali Marurui slums in Roysambu Sub-County, Nairobi. Ruth’s life was marked by early struggles, including dropping out of school due to a lack of sanitary pads, falling into addiction, and becoming involved in criminal activities. Her journey took a dark turn with time spent in prison and the tragic loss of many friends and family members to violence, disease, and imprisonment. Despite these adversities, Ruth’s story of resilience and redemption inspired her to create Flowers On Thorns CBO. She founded the organization to support young people, particularly those facing similar challenges, and provide them with opportunities for change.
            Programs and Services.</p>
        <p>Led by founder <strong>Ruth Njeri</strong> and a passionate team of volunteers, social workers, trainers, and local partners, Flowers On Thorns remains rooted in community and driven by love.</p>
